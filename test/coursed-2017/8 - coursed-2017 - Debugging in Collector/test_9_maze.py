```
collector.forward() # limit: 2
collector.left() # limit: 2
collector.right()
collector.collect() # limit: 1
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```

# Start
for i in range(2):
    for i in range(3):
        collector.forward()
    collector.right()
    for i in range(3):
        collector.forward()
    collector.left()
    for i in range(20):
