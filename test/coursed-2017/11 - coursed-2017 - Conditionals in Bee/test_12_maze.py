Collect all of the nectar or make all the honey. You can only collect nectar from flowers and make honey from honeycombs. Check any space to see if there is a flower or honeycomb. There will only ever be one flower or one honeycomb behind each cloud.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
while bee.path_ahead():
    bee.forward()
    if bee.at_flower():
        bee.get_nectar()
    else:
        bee.make_honey()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
