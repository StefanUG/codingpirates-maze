*"Now I just want to make honey."*

Some of these clouds might have honeycombs under them.  Be sure to check if a honeycomb is hiding behind each cloud! If there is a honeycomb, the bee will only need to make honey *once*.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_honeycomb():
    # Do this
while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(2):
    bee.forward()
    bee.forward()
    if bee.at_honeycomb():
        bee.make_honey()
    bee.left()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
