Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
zombie.forward() # limit: 1
zombie.right()
zombie.left()
if zombie.path_left():
    # Do this
while not zombie.at_finish():
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
while not zombie.at_finish():
    zombie.forward()
    if zombie.path_left():
        zombie.left()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
