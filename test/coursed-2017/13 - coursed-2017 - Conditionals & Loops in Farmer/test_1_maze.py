*"Corn you help me harvest today?"*

Help the harvester check her row of corn to see if anything is ready to pick.  Use conditionals to look at each sprout.  Every stalk will have either **0 or 1** pieces of corn ready to harvest.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
if farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
farmer.pick_corn()
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
while farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(5):
    farmer.forward()
    if farmer.has_corn():
        farmer.pick_corn()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
