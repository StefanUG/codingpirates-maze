Can you figure out how to pick the pumpkin?  Make sure to collect all of the corn along the way!

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.left()
while not farmer.at_pumpkin():
    # Do this
while farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
if farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
if farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
farmer.pick_corn()
farmer.pick_pumpkin()
```
'''

# When run

# Start
while not farmer.at_pumpkin():
    if farmer.path_ahead():
        farmer.forward()
        while farmer.has_corn():
            farmer.pick_corn()
    else:
        farmer.left()
farmer.pick_pumpkin()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
