*"Corn, lettuce, AND pumpkins! Help me harvest them all."*

Each plant will have either one piece of corn, one head of lettuce, or one pumpkin.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
if farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
if farmer.has_pumpkin():
    # Do this
farmer.pick_corn()
farmer.pick_pumpkin()
farmer.pick_lettuce()
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
while farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(7):
    farmer.forward()
    if farmer.has_corn():
        farmer.pick_corn()
    else:
        if farmer.has_pumpkin():
            farmer.pick_pumpkin()
        else:
            if farmer.has_lettuce():
                farmer.pick_lettuce()
