The pumpkins mark the place where you should `turn right`. Otherwise keep going forward, but remember to collect all of the lettuce or corn along the way. 

**Each hidden crop has only one corn or lettuce.**

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward() # limit: 1
farmer.right()
if farmer.has_lettuce():
    # Do this
if farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
farmer.pick_pumpkin()
farmer.pick_corn()
farmer.pick_lettuce()
while farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
while farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(6):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
while farmer.path_ahead():
    farmer.forward()
    if farmer.has_corn():
        farmer.pick_corn()
    else:
        if farmer.has_lettuce():
            farmer.pick_lettuce()
        else:
            if farmer.has_pumpkin():
                farmer.pick_pumpkin()
                farmer.right()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
