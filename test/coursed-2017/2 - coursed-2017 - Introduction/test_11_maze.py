Now there's more treasure.  Can you help Laurel collect it all?

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
collector.forward() # limit: 5
collector.right()
collector.left()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
collector.collect() # limit: 2
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(3):
    collector.forward()
collector.right()
for i in range(4):
    collector.collect()
for i in range(3):
    collector.forward()
collector.right()
for i in range(4):
    collector.collect()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
