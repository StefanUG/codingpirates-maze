___

Take the same path as before, but this time, use a repeat loop to collect treasure when you get to it.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
collector.forward()
collector.right()
collector.left()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
collector.collect()
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(4):
    collector.forward()
collector.right()
for i in range(4):
    collector.forward()
collector.right()
collector.forward()
for i in range(5):
    collector.collect()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
