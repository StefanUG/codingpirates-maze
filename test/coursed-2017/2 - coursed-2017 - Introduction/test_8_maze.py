When you have several of the same block in a row, try using a `repeat` loop, instead.  This will do the same thing with less code!

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bird.forward() # limit: 3
bird.left()
bird.right()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
bird.left()
bird.forward()
bird.right()
for i in range(3):
    bird.forward()
bird.right()
bird.forward()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
