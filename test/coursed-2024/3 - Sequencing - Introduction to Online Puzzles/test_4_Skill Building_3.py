Help the bird get to the pig. There is one extra blue `move forward` block.

Throw away the extra block by removing it from the other blocks and dragging it back to the toolbox.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bird.forward()
bird.left()
bird.right()
```
