More clouds! 

Check underneath every cloud to see if it is hiding a flower before you get nectar. If there is a flower underneath the cloud, the bee will need to get nectar *once*.  

Remember: Not all clouds hide the same thing!

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
bee.forward()
bee.forward()
bee.right()
for i in range(2):
    bee.forward()
    if bee.at_flower():
        bee.get_nectar()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
