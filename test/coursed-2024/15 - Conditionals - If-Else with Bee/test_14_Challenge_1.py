Collect all of the nectar and make all of the honey. You can only collect nectar from flowers and make honey from honeycombs. Check every space to see if there is a flower or honeycomb.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(7):
    while bee.path_ahead():
        if bee.at_flower():
            bee.get_nectar()
        else:
            if bee.at_honeycomb():
                bee.make_honey()
        bee.forward()
    bee.right()

# Keep this
