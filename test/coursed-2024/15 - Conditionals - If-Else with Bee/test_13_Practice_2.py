Conditionals can be helpful, even when you know exactly what is in each spot!

Collect all of the nectar and make all of the honey.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar() # limit: 1
bee.make_honey() # limit: 1
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(7):
    bee.forward()
    if bee.at_flower():
        bee.get_nectar()
    else:
        bee.make_honey()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
