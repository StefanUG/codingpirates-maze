Underneath this cloud, there might be a flower with an unknown amount of nectar, or a honeycomb with an unknown amount of honey.  

Can you write a program that can handle either?

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

#
# Actions

bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()

#
# Loops

while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(1):

while bee.nectar() > 0:
    # Do this
1

#
# Conditionals

if bee.path_right():
    # Do this
if bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this

#
# Functions

def get_nectar_make_honey():
    while bee.nectar() > 0:
        bee.get_nectar()
    while bee.honey() > 0:
        bee.make_honey()

# Start
