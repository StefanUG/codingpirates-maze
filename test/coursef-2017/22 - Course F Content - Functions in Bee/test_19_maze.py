Now try building a function to solve this maze.  How is it different from last time?  

Turn left at the honeycomb and right at the flowers.  
**Note:** Some corners are unmarked!

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

#
# Actions

bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()

#
# Loops

while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(1):

while bee.nectar() > 0:
    # Do this
1

#
# Conditionals

if bee.path_right():
    # Do this
if bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this

# Functions
