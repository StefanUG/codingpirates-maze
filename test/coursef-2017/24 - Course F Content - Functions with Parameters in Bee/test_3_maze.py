Time to put the function to the test! 

Let's see if it makes collecting these three rows of nectar any easier.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

#
# Actions

bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar() # limit: 1

#
# Loops

for i in range(1):

1

#
# Conditionals

if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
if bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
if bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this

#
# Functions

rowOfNectar()
def rowOfNectar():

# When run

def rowOfNectar():
    for i in range(7):
        bee.forward()
        if bee.at_flower():
            bee.get_nectar()

# Start
