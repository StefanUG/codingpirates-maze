Now, let's combine the `counter` variable with a `math` block! 

How can you use the `counter` variable to navigate this garden with the fewest number of blocks possible?

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

#
# Actions

bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()

#
# Math

???
???*???

#
# Loops

for counter in range(1, 11, 1):

for i in range():
    # Do this

#
# Variables

counter
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for counter in range(1, 6, 1):
    bee.left()
    for i in range(counter):
        bee.forward()
    for i in range(counter*3):
        bee.get_nectar()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
