Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
collector.east() # limit: 1
collector.west()
collector.north()
collector.south()
collector.collect()
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(5):
    collector.east()
    collector.collect()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
