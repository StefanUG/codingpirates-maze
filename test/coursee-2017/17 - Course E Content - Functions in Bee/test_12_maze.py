- turn toward the branch in the path
- move forward
- make all of the honey
- return to the main path 
- turn back to the original direction

bee.left()
bee.right()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
while bee.honey() > 0:
    # Do this
move_and_make_honey()
def move_and_make_honey():

# When run

def move_and_make_honey():
    bee.right()
    bee.forward()
    while bee.honey() > 0:
        bee.make_honey()
