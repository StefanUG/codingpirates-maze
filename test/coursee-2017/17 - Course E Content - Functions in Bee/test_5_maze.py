The `move and get nectar` function turns the bee, collects nectar, and then returns the bee to where it started.  

Use the `move and get nectar` function to collect all of the nectar.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.left()
bee.right()
bee.make_honey()
for i in range(???): # limit: 1
    # Do this
move_and_get_nectar()
```
'''

# When run

def move_and_get_nectar():
    bee.right()
    bee.forward()
    bee.get_nectar()
    bee.backward()
    bee.left()

# Start
bee.forward()
move_and_get_nectar()
bee.forward()
bee.forward()
move_and_get_nectar()
for i in range(3):
    bee.forward()
