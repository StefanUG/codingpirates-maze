**Challenge:** These flowers can have a different amount of nectar each time you run the puzzle.   

Create a function that collects all of the nectar from each flower.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.left()
bee.right()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
while bee.nectar() > 0:
    # Do this
collect_all_nectar()
```
'''

# When run

def collect_all_nectar():
    while bee.nectar() > 0:
        bee.get_nectar()

# Start
for i in range(5):
    bee.forward()
    bee.right()
    bee.forward()
    collect_all_nectar()
