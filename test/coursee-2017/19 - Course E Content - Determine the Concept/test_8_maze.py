Can you help the bee collect the nectar from the flowers? 

You can only collect nectar from flowers, but you can check any space to see if there is a flower.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.left()
bee.right()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
while bee.nectar() == 0:
    # Do this
while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
bee_ifNectarAmount
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
if bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
if bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(4):
    while bee.path_ahead():
        bee.forward()
        if bee.at_flower():
            bee.get_nectar()
    bee.left()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
