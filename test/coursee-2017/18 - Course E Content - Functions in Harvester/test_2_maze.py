*"Oooh, veggies are cropping up everywhere!"*

Now help the harvester pick all of the corn on the way to the pumpkin at the end.
___
##### Note: Every square on the path that leads to the pumpkin will either have *one* corn or nothing.  You will need to use an `if` statement to check whether there is corn before you try to pick it!
