Let's try that again, but with more piles!

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.remove() # limit: 1
while farmer.at_pile():
    # Do this
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
# 
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(3):
    farmer.forward()
    while farmer.at_pile():
        farmer.remove()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
