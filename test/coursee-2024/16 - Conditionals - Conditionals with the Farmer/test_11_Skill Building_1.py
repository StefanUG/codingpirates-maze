The lettuce is now only at the end of the path.  
Travel down the path **until** you reach a head of lettuce, then continue to pick it **while** there is still some left.  

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.pick_lettuce()
while farmer.has_lettuce():
    # Do this
while not farmer.has_lettuce():
    # Do this
# 
```
'''

# When run

# Start
while not farmer.has_lettuce():
    farmer.forward()
while farmer.has_lettuce():
    farmer.pick_lettuce()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
