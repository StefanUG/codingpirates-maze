Did you notice that there was a lot of repeated code in that last puzzle?  We can save space by calling that code `pick along path` and using a new function to call the other functions!

Use `pick along path` to solve this puzzle again using fewer blocks.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

#
# Actions

farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.pick_corn()
farmer.pick_pumpkin()
farmer.pick_lettuce()

#
# Loops

while not farmer.at_pumpkin():
    # Do this
while farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
while farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this

#
# Conditionals

if farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
if farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
if farmer.has_corn():
    # Do this
