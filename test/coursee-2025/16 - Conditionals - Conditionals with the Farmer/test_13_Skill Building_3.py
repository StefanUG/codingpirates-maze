The lettuce is scattered all over the garden.  
Travel down each path **until** you reach a head of lettuce, then continue to pick it **while** there is still some left.  

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.pick_lettuce()
while farmer.has_lettuce():
    # Do this
while not farmer.has_lettuce():
    # Do this
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
if farmer.path_ahead():
    # Do this
else:
    # Otherwise this
# 
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(6):
    while not farmer.has_lettuce():
        farmer.forward()
    while farmer.has_lettuce():
        farmer.pick_lettuce()
    farmer.right()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
