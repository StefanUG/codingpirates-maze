Oh my!  This pile is so big that it's hard to guess how much dirt is in it.  

___

We've added a new block to the toolbox called the `while there is a pile` block.  Use this to remove dirt only while there is still some to scoop! 

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward()
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.remove() # limit: 1
while farmer.at_pile():
    # Do this
# 
```
'''

# When run

# Start
farmer.forward()
while farmer.at_pile():
    farmer.remove()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
