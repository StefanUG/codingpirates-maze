Time for a shorter puzzle!  Move one way, then another to get the bird to the pig.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bird.north()
bird.south()
bird.east()
bird.west()
for i in range(3):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
bird.east()
bird.south()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
