Can you combine two different loops to move toward the pumpkins, then collect them all?

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
farmer.forward() # limit: 1
farmer.right()
farmer.left()
farmer.pick_pumpkin()
for i in range(5):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(5):
    farmer.forward()
for i in range(4):
    farmer.pick_pumpkin()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
