Loops can be used to repeat more than moves.  

Use loops to collect all four of the pumpkins.

Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```

farmer.left()
farmer.pick_pumpkin()
for i in range(4):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
farmer.forward()
for i in range(4):
    farmer.pick_pumpkin()
