Sometimes there is more than one way to solve the same problem. Sometimes it's faster to go backwards than it is to go forwards!

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bird.forward()
bird.backward()
bird.left()
bird.right()
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
bird.backward()
bird.backward()
bird.right()
bird.backward()
bird.backward()
bird.right()
bird.backward()
bird.backward()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
