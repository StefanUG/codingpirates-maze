You can only collect nectar from flowers, but you can check any space to see if there is a flower. If there is a flower under any of these clouds, the bee will need to collect nectar *once*.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar()
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(7):
    bee.forward()
    if bee.at_flower():
        bee.get_nectar()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
