In this puzzle, we know that every flower has exactly one nectar, but the flowers aren't spaced evenly.

Get all of the nectar using as few blocks as possible.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar() # limit: 1
bee.make_honey()
if bee.at_flower():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
for i in range(7):
    bee.forward()
    if bee.at_flower():
        bee.get_nectar()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
