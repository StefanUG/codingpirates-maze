Collect all of the nectar and make all the honey. You can collect all of the nectar in one flower by using the `while nectar > 0` loop.

---
Here are elements from the toolbox.
You can use them in your code:
```
bee.forward()
bee.right()
bee.left()
bee.get_nectar() # limit: 1
bee.make_honey() # limit: 1
while bee.nectar() > 0:
    # Do this
while bee.path_ahead():
    # Do this
for i in range(???):
    # Do this
```
'''

# When run

# Start
while bee.path_ahead():
    bee.forward()
    while bee.nectar() > 0:
        bee.get_nectar()
bee.right()
while bee.path_ahead():
    bee.forward()
    while bee.honey() > 0:
        bee.make_honey()

# Keep this
Puzzle.done()
